Project Summary:

"JogLog" was an experiment of basic programmatic UI customizations, intermediate MapKit/CoreLocation features, and explorations of the iOS MediaPlayer and MessageUI Framework.

"JogLog" is a jogging utility that allows users to track/map their jogs and receive their stats in an email summary. Users may also create a playlist on their iPhone titled "JogLog" in order to listen to music natively within the app. Note that this app may work only on provisioned devices and not in the iOS Simulator, as the Simulator has no access to a device's iPod library.
